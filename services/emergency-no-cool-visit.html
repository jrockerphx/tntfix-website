<h2>What This Service Includes</h2>
<p>
                    When your A/C stops working completely, especially during extreme heat, every hour counts. Our emergency service provides rapid assessment and repair to restore cooling as quickly as possible.
                </p>
<ul>
<li>Prioritized scheduling during heat emergencies</li>
<li>Rapid diagnostic to identify the failure point</li>
<li>On-the-spot repair when parts are available</li>
<li>Temporary solutions to restore partial cooling if needed</li>
<li>Clear guidance on repair vs. replacement decisions</li>
<li>Follow-up support to ensure system stability</li>
</ul>
<h2>Common Emergency Repairs We Handle</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Failed capacitor:</strong> most common A/C failure, usually fixable same-visit</li>
<li><strong>Bad contactor:</strong> prevents compressor from starting, quick replacement</li>
<li><strong>Tripped breaker/blown fuse:</strong> electrical issue diagnosis and repair</li>
<li><strong>Frozen evaporator coil:</strong> airflow/refrigerant issue requiring thaw and correction</li>
<li><strong>Thermostat failure:</strong> wiring or control board issues</li>
<li><strong>Low refrigerant:</strong> leak detection and recharge (when feasible)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Our Emergency Service Promise</h2>
<p>
                    During Phoenix heat waves (typically June-September when temperatures exceed 110°F), we understand that a no-cool situation is more than an inconvenience—it's a health and safety concern. We prioritize emergency calls and aim for same-day or next-day service whenever possible.
                </p>
<h2>Honest Assessment</h2>
<p>
                    If we determine that your system needs a major repair (compressor, evaporator coil, etc.) or full replacement, we'll be upfront about it. We'll discuss temporary cooling solutions, repair costs vs. replacement costs, and help you make an informed decision without pressure tactics.
                </p>
<h2>Parts Availability</h2>
<p>
                    We stock common failure parts (capacitors, contactors, thermostats) to enable same-visit repairs. For less common parts, we'll provide a timeline and options for temporary cooling while parts are ordered.
                </p>
<h2>Pricing</h2>
<p>
                    We understand that emergencies don't happen at convenient times, and when they do, getting help quickly matters. After-hours or emergency calls are given our highest priority and are typically evaluated or addressed the same day.
                </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Standard service call:</strong> $149 (includes diagnosis + first hour, charged upon arrival, repairs billed separately)</li>
<li><strong>Emergency service call:</strong> $449 (after-hours, weekends, or same-day priority during heat emergencies)</li>
<li><strong>Common repairs:</strong> $75-$350 depending on parts needed</li>
<li><strong>Major repairs:</strong> quoted after diagnosis</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h2>Emergency Calls</h2>
<p>
                    Emergency calls are prioritized so we can help restore comfort as quickly as possible, even when that means interrupting scheduled or in-progress work.
<p>
To support immediate dispatch and on-call availability, a $449 emergency service fee applies to all emergency we dispatch — during regular business hours, after hours, weekends, or holidays. This fee covers the rapid response and on-site evaluation, regardless of whether you choose to proceed with the recommended repair.
<p>
If your emergency can be handled same day, during regular business hours, without disrupting scheduled work, we will let you know and the emergency fee will be waived. Our goal is to get you cooling—not to create unnecessary expense.
<p>
Emergency requests submitted after hours, on weekends, or holidays are based on technician availability. We will make every effort to confirm availability and dispatch within one hour of receiving your request; however, availability cannot be guaranteed. For this reason, we strongly recommend contacting multiple service providers and not waiting on a single response.
<p>
If you have not heard from TNT Fix within one hour, please assume we are unavailable at that time and continue seeking service. Prolonged exposure to extreme heat can be dangerous, and your safety is the priority.
                </p>
<h2>Temporary Cooling Solutions</h2>
<p>
                    If your system needs parts we don't have on hand, we can often get you partial cooling by bypassing failed components or adjusting system operation. We'll also provide guidance on using fans, managing sun exposure, and staying safe until full repairs are complete.
                </p>
